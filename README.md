# Testing with gtest example

Basic exmple of testing with gtest

We just have a class with one public method printing "Hello world" and returning _true_ value to be compiled and packed as a static *.a library

Makefile has target to iterate test-*.cpp files and treat them as tests. Each such file will be compiled and linked into test-% executable
